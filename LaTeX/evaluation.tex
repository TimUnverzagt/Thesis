\label{ch:evaluation}
%*****************************************
\hint{This chapter should describe how the evaluation of the implemented mechanism was done. \\ \\
1. Which evaluation method is used and why? Simulations, prototype? \\
2. What is the goal of the evaluation? Comparison? Proof of concept? \\
3. Wich metrics are used for characterizing the performance, costs, fairness, and efficiency of the system?\\
4. What are the parameter settings used in the evaluation and why? If possible always justify why a certain threshold has been chose for a particular parameter.  \\
5. What is the outcome of the evaluation? \\ \\
The section should have a length of about five to ten pages.}
\section{Goal and Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Early Pruning: \\
		Proof of concept\\
		+ trial of select early stopping points \\
	\item Transfer to NLP: \\
		Proof of concept 
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Early Pruning: \\
	LTH holds for mask with less than 50\% of iterations to early stop\\
	
	\item Transfer to NLP: \\
	Network holds performance to within 1\%-point while at least 50\% weights are pruned
\end{itemize}
