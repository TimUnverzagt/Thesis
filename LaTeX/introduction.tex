\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item LTH has demonstrated extreme pruning on different architectures
	\item Study of lottery-ticket emergence points might result in a reasoned early pruning approach
	\item LTH might bring a new and promising pruning approach to NLP
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Statement and Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
		Calculate pruning masks earlier in training and check if LTH still holds.\\
		Observing when lottery-tickets are no longer found might improve understanding of early pruning.
	\item Research whether the point of lottery-ticket-emergence can be estimated "a-priori". 
	\item 
		Implement an architecture comparable to the ones studied in the lottery-ticket hypothesis performing well on an NLP-task with similar structure.
	\item Determine whether the LTH holds on said architecture.
	
\end{itemize}
